# About GalaxyTraders

GalaxyTraders is a space trading game modeled after <a hrf="http://www.aatraders.com/">Alien Assault Traders</a>, and uses Meteor/NodeJS, Bootstrap, MongoDB, and related tools. Browse the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SamClayton/GalaxyTraders) for more technical details.

## Gameplay

In GalaxyTraders, you take the role of ambitious merchant captain of your space-faring vessel, seeking out lucrative trade routes, smuggling contraband, upgrading your ship, and transporting colonists, all while dodging Imperial interdiction, pirate attacks, and your well-armed competitors. Ultimately, you may found and defend colonies, and form a powerful Trade Association with your friends to realize your dreams of galactic domination.

## History

This is a solo project that I started for a couple of reasons. As a professional software engineer, I wanted to learn current JavaScript tools and frameworks. After some experience with Angular and Cordova on the front end, Meteor jumped out at me as both a technically intriguing platform to learn while writing a full-stack NodeJS app that is responsive and enjoyable.

I played Alien Assault Traders for years. It is a fork of two earlier PHP codebases, [Black Nova Traders](https://forums.blacknova.net/) and [Nova Gaming System](https://www.openhub.net/p/novasystem), in turn inspired by the popular BBS game [TradeWars](http://www.eisonline.com/), which itself was inspired by the 1974 BASIC-language game Star Trader. These are essentially GalaxyTrader's cultural roots, a set of concepts with over 40 years of history behind them.

Around 2007, I developed a set of PHP and JS tools and a set of Greasemonkey user scripts to help me collect and analyze data from AAT games. I started my most recent foray into JS by reviving those tools as a Chrome extension early in 2016, but I quickly noticed that the game software wasn't being actively updated or maintained, relied on numerous long-deprecated PHP 4 functions, won't run unmodified on up-to-date LAMP installs, and does not render correctly in today's mobile browsers. While I contributed a couple of patches to the project, I wasn't interested in inheriting another legacy codebase for a game with a shrinking community of players.

I'm dating myself here, but as a teenager, I played [BBS door games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBS_door). (Yes, with a landline modem.) I also enjoyed Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, which was purportedly the inspiration fo Star Trader. I even played a snail mail game that simulated space armada combat. Arguably, this is all some hipster nonsense, since I'm basically telling you that I was into space gaming _before it was cool._ "You kids turn your infernal FPS down and get off my lawn!", I'm shouting at you, while waving my cane, which decidedly does _not_ have the LTEs or the Wi-Fis. Or I'm just forever fascinated with and nostalgic for this one very specific form of gaming.
