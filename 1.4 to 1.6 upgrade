* These packages have been updated to new versions that are not backwards
compatible.
GalaxyTraders: updated to Meteor 1.6.0.1.

-- Notice --

1.4.3: The account packages for different services (e.g. facebook, twitter, google, etc.) have been split and now make it possible to avoid bundling Blaze in the client bundle for projects not using Blaze. If found in the
       .meteor/packages file, these packages have been split automatically. Assuming there are no other Blaze dependencies, the "<service>-config-ui" package can be removed if there is no need for the Blaze configuration
       interface.
