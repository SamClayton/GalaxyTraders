        <h1>About GalaxyTraders</h1>
        <p>GalaxyTraders is a space trading game modeled after <a hrf="http://www.aatraders.com/">Alien Assault Traders</a>, and uses Meteor/NodeJS, Bootstrap, MongoDB, and related tools. Browse the <a href="https://github.com/SamClayton/GalaxyTraders">GitHub repository</a> for more technical details.</p>
        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>In GalaxyTraders, you take the role of ambitious merchant captain of your space-faring vessel, seeking out lucrative trade routes, smuggling contraband, upgrading your ship, and transporting colonists, all while dodging Imperial interdiction, pirate attacks, and your well-armed competitors. Ultimately, you may found and defend colonies, and form a powerful Trade Association with your friends to realize your dreams of galactic domination.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>This is a solo project that I started for a couple of reasons. As a professional software engineer, I wanted to learn current JavaScript tools and frameworks. After some experience with Angular and Cordova on the front end, Meteor jumped out at me as both a technically intriguing platform to learn while writing a full-stack NodeJS app that is responsive and enjoyable.</p>
        <p>I played Alien Assault Traders for years. It is a fork of two earlier PHP codebases, <a href="https://forums.blacknova.net/">Black Nova Traders</a> and <a href="https://www.openhub.net/p/novasystem">Nova Gaming System</a>, in turn inspired by the popular BBS game <a href="http://www.eisonline.com/">TradeWars</a>, which itself was inspired by the 1974 BASIC-language game Star Trader. These are essentially GalaxyTrader's cultural roots, a set of concepts with over 40 years of history behind them.</p>
        <p>Around 2007, I developed a set of PHP and JS tools and a set of Greasemonkey user scripts to help me collect and analyze data from AAT games. I started my most recent foray into JS by reviving those tools as a Chrome extension early in 2016, but I quickly noticed that the game software wasn't being actively updated or maintained, relied on numerous long-deprecated PHP 4 functions, won't run unmodified on up-to-date LAMP installs, and does not render correctly in today's mobile browsers. While I contributed a couple of patches to the project, I wasn't interested in inheriting another legacy codebase for a game with a shrinking community of players.</p>
        <p>I'm dating myself here, but as a teenager, I played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBS_door">BBS door games</a>. (Yes, with a landline modem.) I also enjoyed Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, which was purportedly the inspiration fo Star Trader. I even played a snail mail game that simulated space armada combat. Arguably, this is all some hipster nonsense, since I'm basically telling you that I was into space gaming <i>before it was cool.</i> "You kids turn your infernal FPS down and get off my lawn!", I'm shouting at you, while waving my cane, which decidedly does <i>not</i> have the LTEs or the Wi-Fis. Or I'm just forever fascinated with and nostalgic for this one very specific form of gaming.</p>
        <p>If you've read this far, you must have nothing better to do, so <a href="/">play the game</a>.</p>
